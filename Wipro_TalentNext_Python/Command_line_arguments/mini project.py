# of numbers separated by hyphens (-). You like all the numbers in string 1 and dislike all the numbers in 
# string 2. The third string contains the numbers given to you. Your initial happiness is 0. For each number 
# in the third string: If itâ€™s present in string 1, add 1 to happiness, If itâ€™s present in string 2, subtract
# 1 from happiness otherwise happiness stays the same. Output your final happiness at the end.
